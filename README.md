# TikTok EDA and Visualization Project

This repository contains an end-of-course project for Course 3: *Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights*. The project focuses on conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and creating visualizations for a TikTok dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
1. Analyze the TikTok dataset for insights into claim vs. opinion videos.
2. Perform data cleaning and visualization using Python (Matplotlib and Seaborn).
3. Create professional dashboards in Tableau for clear communication of results.

### Tasks Covered
- **Data Loading & Cleaning:** Using `pandas` and `numpy` for data structuring and cleaning.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Visualizing distributions and detecting outliers.
  - Investigating relationships between key variables such as video views, likes, shares, and comments.
- **Visualization:**
  - Boxplots, histograms, scatterplots in Python.
  - Dashboards in Tableau, accessible for individuals with visual impairments.
- **Insights:**
  - Patterns and trends distinguishing claim videos from opinion videos.
  - Engagement metrics across different author ban statuses.

## Key Features
- **Python Scripts:** Code to load, clean, and explore the dataset.
- **Interactive Tableau Dashboard:** Claims vs. opinions visualized for actionable insights.
- **Executive Summary:** Key takeaways to assist business decision-making.
